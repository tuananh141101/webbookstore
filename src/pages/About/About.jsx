                    We have an incredible collection of used books that include
                    both fiction and non-fiction. If you are looking for a new
                    author to read or something out of the ordinary we are worth
                    the visit. We are also planning to expand our collection
                    into specific subject fields in the future.

                    Kalium has created an online store and in the coming months
                    will begin to upload a partial listing of our books for
                    purchase along with other items that we sell. The store is
                    operational and functional and there are some books now
                    listed. We regularly post books for sale on our Facebook
